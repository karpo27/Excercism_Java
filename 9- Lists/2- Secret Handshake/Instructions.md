# Instructions
There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:

- Given the input 3, the function would return the array ["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.

- Given the input 19, the function would return the array ["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary. Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary) has caused the array to be reversed.
